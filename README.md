# This project is part of my training session for students at ProITBridge

The spam_ham_classifier project is a machine learning model designed for teaching how to classify emails as either spam or ham (non-spam). It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a supervised learning algorithm to predict the category of incoming emails based on their content.
# Dataset:
The project utilizes a labeled dataset of emails, where each email is categorized as either spam or ham. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the machine learning models.
